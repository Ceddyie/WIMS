## *What is it?:*
An application to simulate the workflow of a warehouse with the help of Apache Kafka.

<br><hr>

## *How does it work?*
The employee can either select a product from the full product list or can enter the product's code. 
With the product ID the employee can either store or pick a specific amount in/from the warehouse. These commands and 
the withcoming data is shared between the two seperate applications via Apache Kafka. This allows the systems
to be updated and to work independently. 

<br><hr>

## *What comes next?*
* implementation of orders â†’ the employee can take care of orders directly in the system
* dark mode/light mode switch
* language switch
